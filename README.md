## Second Course Project - Update UI Components with Events and State:
- Use create-react-app to bootstrap your project

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Continue to retrieve your local API data to render a list of UI items.

- Continue to render your local API data using some combination of Cards, Avatars, List, etc. elements. These UI elements will be from the MUI version 5 package.

- Add at least two ways in which a user may interact with your UI (click, input, etc.) and handle the events with some response by your UI.

- Use the useState hook to store some local state and have some mechanism for updating that state. Make sure you use a proper method for updating state that depends on previous state!

- Submit a Github & Netlify URL for your source code for this assignment.


- Push your repository to GitHub, deploy your repo using Netlify, and submit both your GitHub URL AND your Netlify URL via this Canvas assignment.
